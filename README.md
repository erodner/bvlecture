## Installation 

First, let us create an anaconda environment. You can do this manually or simply use
the predefined list of packages available in this repository.
Type in the anaconda prompt the following commands:
```bash
conda create -n bvlecture --file conda-env.txt python==3.8
conda activate bvlecture
```

The environment should be now active, test it by running your jupyter notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
